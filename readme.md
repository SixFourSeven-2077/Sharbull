# Sharbull
Heyy, Sharbull is a small project I made in an afternoon and actively updating daily.
Its key features are : 
* Captcha on member join
* AntiSpam (https://pypi.org/project/Discord-Anti-Spam/)
* Spammer detection with flags 
* Shared reputation system

This project is not perfect, feel free to open a thread in issues.
It also not very customizable as a lot of options are hard coded. I am aware and working on it!

## Installation
**Requires Python 3.8 or later**

- Make a new virtual environment and activate it
- Install the dependencies : `pip install -r requirements`
- Create a new file named "token" in the main directory in which you will copypaste your bot's token
- Run the bot with `python main.py`
